Water and sanitation data analytics:

1. Introduction to the problem statement

Bringing analytics based on water and safely managed sanitation used in different countries and plotting how the countries are performing. 

2. Abstract

It is a fundamental and basic need to have pure drinking water and proper sanitation facilities in order to lead a healthy life. Although many people have gained access to basic sanitation services there are still many people especially in the rural areas lacking basic services. We are building a model that plots the performance of different countries in a graphical manner by training the dataset on the various water and sanitation facilities across the countries.

3. Approach

The first part analysis will be done on the water and the sanitation data. We will visualize the data using Machine Learning and will perform Exploratory Data Analysis on it and then will plot the graphs accordingly between countries or regions and basic water and sanitation services. In the UI part there will be options to search for countries or regions for which the user wants to visualize the data and based on the search criteria graphs will be plotted depicting the performance with respect to water and sanitation facilities.
