1. Earthquake damage detection: 
Modelling earthquake damage based on the impact of earthquake and various geographical conditions. Based on the dataset of previous earthquakes happened in areas with similar geographical conditions like locations with number of buildings, building size and population we will be developing a model that depicts the impact of a recent earthquake.

2. Food safety score for San Fransisco restuarants:
